                        <p>Literary Hall is a brick library building and museum in Romney, West Virginia, built in 1869 and
                            1870 by the Romney Literary Society. Founded in 1819, the society was the first literary organization
                            of its kind in the present-day state of West Virginia, and one of the first in the United States.
                            In 1846, the society constructed a building which housed the Romney Classical Institute and its
                            library. During the Civil War the library's contents were plundered by Union Army forces, and
                            many of its 3,000 volumes were scattered or destroyed. The society transferred ownership of its
                            Romney Classical Institute campus to the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind in 1870
                            and in that year completed Literary Hall, where the society reconstituted its library collection
                            and revived its literary activities. The Romney Literary Society's last meeting was held there
                            in 1886. In 1979 the hall was placed on the National Register of Historic Places/p>
